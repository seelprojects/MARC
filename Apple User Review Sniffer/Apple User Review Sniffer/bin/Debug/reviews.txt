Can not go to links on posts.  Will not let me share with specific people only general sharing.  Real pain.  Can not enjoy Facebook on iPad.   Seems to be fine on iPod and laptop.  Please fix!
The app works pretty well for me. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is that there is no peek and pop functioning. 

My Facebook app notified me that I should try it, but haven't been able to get it to work on many different links.
I think it is funny that people are complaining about too man ads, how do you think they make money off you suckers? Keep posting more and more about your personal life, that will keep the Facebook engine running strong!
Bad
It's rather *insane* that a 95mb app can accumulate a data and documents cache of over a gigabyte.

Why does every single little item from my feed from 2 months ago need to be cached in this app? It is insane.

Even more insane is that Facebook's app provides no way to clear it. So, so sloppy... 

Do they think we spend money buying our phones just so their app can throw its dirty laundry and trash all over without cleaning up after itself? So irresponsible! - my parents would have grounded me for a month if I acted like that.
Adding a photo to an album from actually making a status is still not an option for me and I have an iPhone 6... It's aggravating when I have to go to my pictures and find the album and update the photos into the album. I really wish that could be fixed
This app is the best thing ever had to see my family and friends
In typical corporate Facebook fashion, in order to make more money and shove ads down our throats they have taken a good app and product and have made it completely unusable. FB better hope they never get any real competition...
Kills battery life and phone resources. It's beyond ridiculous and not needed.
A company with such large development resources, the innovation in the app has slowed dramatically
The icon for live broadcasting does not appear I have deleted and downloaded the app multiple times but still does not work.
Oh god please change notifications back. "Highlights" is causing me to lose a ton of notifications and it skips hours' worth of them and I can't see them! I was hoping "highlights" was just a misguided experiment and you'd changed back permanently. Please get rid of it or let us opt out of it. I'm missing so many notifications it's insane.
Use to be a good app now its just junk and just crashes all the time, Facebook is goin down hill
This app is great! I'm missing the option to share a video that I've just watched to a friend via private message. That was a big plus for me. Bring that back and I'll find a way to get 6 stars on here lol
I have used and enjoyed the app. Now there was an update that I downloaded a few days ago. My Facebook app no longer works!!
My Facebook is crashing! Opens then crashes! Why???!?!?
I can't open the file that my classmate sent me in my group....can u fix it again
Every time I try to clear my recent searches, it takes me to a blank screen with random numbers at the top and freezes. The app often freezes up and is extremely slow.
The Facebook mobile app is awesome! I use it all the time and it's great for managing multiple profiles. It also works very well with its companion app Pages!
It keeps flagging notifications but when I click on the marketplace button, it says there is a problem connecting. It's really annoying.
every time I go to the Facebook app, it crashes after a few seconds. It's frustrating because I can't get to my messages
I'm saving articles now to read while on the computer because the app opens to blank pages.
Can you please reduce the size of the app with improving the features???
THEY ARE BRAINWASHING YOU.
If every update it's going to get worst please stop it crashes all the time two thumbs down üëéüèºüëéüèº
I was using a very old version of this app because I refused to download the new one without messenger. Finally last week I broke down and updated because the old one would constantly freeze my phone. Well that was a waste because now I don't have messenger AND the app freezes up my iPhone 6 whenever I try to use it. Time to delete Facebook. It's not worth this frustration!
Horrible app! If I didn't have so many friends and family using this app then it would have been deleted. The app constantly freezes and the only way to get back to the home screen is to restart the phone... Also the videos lose sound throughout, you can't edit some of the posts. You can't tag people in posts. It's old and out dated. Facebook is washed up, just like MySpace. Can't wait for the next social media app so I can get rid of this fail one.
I just downloaded the latest version of Facebook, and now all of the sudden in-app links do not open. I just get a blank screen. I tried to explore my in-app settings, same blank screen. Is this a virus?? Is anyone else having this issue?
Some people really don't want to use the messenger app.
I have and iphone 5c but it'll let me get on it for a little bit and then crash üòëüòí it does this with messenger too.
deleted your app. bc now you force us to DL messenger.
meth
RIP Facebook your just like Meek and The gram is Drake on the social
Facebook
First of all, the app's cache is OUT OF CONTROL. It starts to use 500-600MB of storage on my phone after just 3-4 days of installing it. WHY is there no maximum cache size?? I am constantly uninstalling and reinstalling this app which wouldn't be so bad except for having to also go through resetting sound, photo, and notification preferences every single time I have to uninstall and reinstall the app.

Recently, if I go from the newsfeed into a post to read a long post or to read multiple responses I'm not able to go back to the newsfeed. The top bar of the screen is light grey and there is no back arrow to exit the post and back to the newsfeed. I have to end the app and reopen it every time that happens. Ridiculous.
Crashing white screen loading slow never opening up has been happening for over a month can't take it anymore I bet 1 million other people or feel the same way about this app please fix it before you disappoint a lot of people!!!!!!
Won't link app accounts!!! It says address is invalid when I try to connect through Facebook with tinder and Instagram! Fix fix fix
Very unpleased that when I got to other people's profiles sometimes it will show me days of things that's posted and then later those same profile I may only be able to see 4 recent posts. Then the next day does the same thing. Including my own profile. I share items so I can go back and look at it but when I go to my own and sometimes and find it and next time can't see but 3-4 of my last few posts it frustrating. Also very upset that I have a 6s and don't have Facebook live but my sister who has the same phone has it. Really?!?! Now right!
The marketplace button does work, won't load.
When I turn off Facebook background activity I expect it to remain off. My battery app is showing that Facebook is still using my background activity when it is off. It's a sizable amount also. This is not acceptable.
Fix it
Crashes very frequently even after updated to latest version
It closes me out a lot and I've updated plenty of times but my go live option for video is not there I do not even have the option.
The newest update will not work without the battery draining background refresh on. With the refresh off, nothing loads and it constantly crashes. But with the refresh on, it works perfectly. The background refresh wouldn't be an issue if it didn't account for almost 50% of my total battery usage. This app is progressively getting worse.
Why can't I redownload it ?? üò©
I'm so super frustrated with this app! It would open and the close repeatedly, I've restarted my phone so many times and I've deleted the app. Now it won't even let me re download it. I'm ver disappointed and if I could I would give it 0 stars.
everytime I open the app it force closes and crashes
One of my favorite reasons to go on Facebook, not the same anymore since you guys took off. Bring it back please!
I wish there was a way to select something like, "Share Only With," then select the few people you don't mind seeing the post you're making. The current way "Share Except..." takes too long because you have to check off 99 people you DON'T want to see the post.
Every time I upload a picture or take a picture straight from Facebook, all my pictures come out blurry! Please fix this!
This app has consistently become worse and worse. Links won't load, app crashes all the time. It's become one of the worst apps I've ever used. I'm ready to delete it and I'm not talking about just delete using the app, I'm talking about delete using Facebook altogether. I guess their day in the sun is gone.
This app crashes constantly.
App keeps crashing when I try to click on my friend request!
My app will not stay open. I have the latest updated version, and as soon as I click the app it opens to a white screen & then closes immediately üòì. Please help to solve this issue, thank you .
Crashes whenever I try to post a picture
So the app crashed while I was posting an update on my status, and now every time I open the app it crashes before it opens.
I've been told you are the source of my  battery drain in my iPhone 6S! So I'm deleting you.
Slow loading. Freezes up.  The market app at the bottom of my screen (where messenger used to be) doesn't work.  Keep getting message that it can't connect.
The app is slow and very lag
Love I can keep in touch with my family and friends
This app consumes over 500 mb of my hard drive. That's by far the most space consumed by any app.
It just shows what my friends are talking about. What happened to trending topics?! üòï
I love this app
I try to open the app, and it crashes and goes back to my home screen. If I try to reopen the app, it just doesn't even open the app at all. I've tried everything from clearing up storage, to reinstalling the app. Nothing works. Fix it please.
Recently I noticed when I click on face book app crashes on my iPhone I think the new update made my phone not working good so please take care of this bog soon thank you and keep up with your good work
Recently, not sure which update, but I am now experiencing weird flashing when I scroll through photos on my newsfeed.  Not the newsfeed itself, but rather when I open a series of photos someone has posted and each and every photo will flash as I scroll. Almost looks like a screenshot is happening, but not from me. ü§î Is Facebook documenting what people are seeing?  No Bueno!!
There wasn't a word that existed to explain this. I made one.
How does an app that weights 99.4mb to download becomes 880mb after, i had to delete it because it didn't make any sense to me. I will just stick to the website instead of the app.
I am having an issue with being able to swipe back to the newsfeed rather than press the back button. The swiping works sometimes, but not always. I think this is probably a bug that needs to be fixed.

Please also add an option to see the news feeds in chronological order, You miss stuff sometimes and it's kind of annoying. Thanks!
The app is crashing and no top trending area.
Whenever I open the app it will crash within thirty seconds.
Continues to crash , loading up very slow . Please fix this.
The Facebook App is a good app. Everything works fine and the app is very fast and responsive. I would give it a five but it keeps freezing. It only happens when I try to watch an older Saved Video. It will load but then freeze at a few seconds in and doesn't go anymore. It's upsetting because I want to look at those videos. Until then I give this app a 3. PLEAE FIX!!üòûüòÅüòÅ
It is generally acknowledged that Facebook‚Äôs Internet browser interface is among the very worst ever developed, but it is nonetheless (barely) usable. But the Facebook app for iOS is absolutely unusable. There is not one thing intuitive about it. Pure trash in every respect. On top of that, it asks you to log in almost every time you leave it and then return. Example: your in the app and you decide to go check the weather, a notification or an email. Return to Facebook. Asked for your password yet again, even though it‚Äôs been only 30 seconds since you left. If you have a complex password as everyone is advised, that‚Äôs a pain in the butt on an iPhone‚Äôs keyboard. Has Zuckerberg never heard of Touch ID? If there only a single app that you could enable Touch ID on, it would be this piece of trash. Recommendation: if you must use Facebook, wait until you get to your computer, i.e. remove this app from your iOS device and save space.
Stupid app of all time, it neither improved from ages nor will improve. Unnecessary push notifications through out the day. App crashes very frequently. Misses or repeats few stories all the times. Goes to settings page on its own.
The "search on this page" button doesn't appear anymore and the reactions when you like something either. Please add this things again.
Get with the times and add a finger print login. If my bank apps can do it there's no reason a trendy technology company like Facebook can't have it too.
With all of these weekly updates being forced, the app has become more of a nuisance than anything. Obviously the developers don't care to read any of the reviews otherwise a lot of these issues would be fixed to begin with.
What the hell!!!! It's like when the first time I downloaded the Facebook app it was no more then 65 MB and now it's 650 MB!!!! Please find a solution!
I can't open any documents posted on my groups when people put some on my iPhone 5S. Some are very important! I have to go to the browser and then open the documents! It's frustrating!
I got the iPhone 6s recently and  the Facebook app crashes immediately after I try to open and the news feed even update even will not work. After the app closes I turns the screen to completely black and I need to close it again. Kindly update the app and remove that bug.
I can't open outside links after the last update.
First separated messages now full of ads, crash, forever loading, very bad support team, promoted bad, annoying, harming  photos...overall this turned in sh*t!!!

When I receive a notification, I go to the notifications section on the app but if I don't touch the actual notification it will stay there. Even when I refresh, it will remain.
Every time I try to use the app it crashes. Please update
my Facebook won't let me comment pictures or send them on messenger. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.
This app crashes all the time. It has eaten up 19% of my battery, so I deleted it. My battery lasts a lot longer now. Use Facebook in Safari until they fix this.
Normally a great app but since the last update, it's constantly kicking me out. It started to do it just every 5-10 min, but now it is worse. I can't even get into it long enough for it to load before it kicks me out. Very frustrating.  I have to go through safari if I need to get on Facebook on my phone. I will be looking forward to a new update.
Please update for iPad it still plays a video even after you close the ad window
Still silently draining battery life with senseless background activities.
Why do I have to see every time a friend of mine likes something on their friend's post . Especially if I don't even know them! This just fills up my news feed with stuff I am not interested in. Is there someway I can get rid of this????
Repeatedly crashed. Can not reinstall as app will not leave my cloud.
Whenever I open my requests page it crashes. Any time before then it's fine but as soon as I open that page it kicks me out to the home screen on my phone.
App does nothing but crash... Had to delete app and use safari to view FB.. App also caused my phone to malfunction until it was deleted
Dearest Facebook app developers,

It is quite annoying and now takes far too many steps to try to share a post to a friend in Messenger. You used to be able to select the drop down arrow on the post and "share in messenger", or something like that. Now this option is unavailable on all posts. Instead, you have to "save" the post, go to your "saved" folder, THEN you can send it to messenger. This seems unnecessary and it's becoming quickly a nuisance. Please bring back the ability to send posts to Messenger directly from a person's post without jumping through the extra hoops. Oh and another suggestion: I do not always want to send posts "separately" to people in messenger, and instead I want to send a post to a group. I don't see this as an option, so please either tell me how to do it or implement it in a future update. Thank you.
Reading feeds works but videos  only will download half of the clip or video.
Either get rid of or give the option to REMOVE these highlights. I am missing real up to date notifications on my event pages which are fundraising events!

Sort by Most Recent needs to be defaulted!
So you want me to write a review, huh? Well, let me tell you something. The app is a battery hog. When sharing posts, I used to be able to choose Share Now, Write Post or Share to Messenger. Now, it chooses Write Post only - I don't get a choice. I put a support ticket in - that's a joke. Your company never gets back to users on that system. Too big of a company - we'll just have to be content with the F-grade app you give us. You keep other developers from making a decent app for your site. It's a joke.
So it crashes faster rather than slower. What's the big deal? Also drains battery
Please stop with the huge updates your killing my phones memory
