'I try Uber for the first time this morning. Well it sucked...I called a cab company instead. I downloaded the app and for what. I went through the steps and received a call from BRUNO that he would pick us up in a few. Then I received a message it was cancelled. First UBER should not allow their drivers to block calls when calling customers. Need less to say UBER never came through and will not use and definitely will not recommend.

'First of all, if you haven’t taken a ride yet make sure you use the coupon "Uber91ue" to get $20 off your first ride! Enter it right before you request a ride. Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! 

The app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.

The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!', Other

Use the promo code BEFORE you make the request on Iphone app the "promo code" box is on the bottom right corner right about the black request button.

'Promo code: reggiea239ue

I love using this app. It's easy to use and it's affordable. I love not having to worry about parking during concerts or events. Especially when you love to drink, it's a better option to have an uber drive you safely back home. Another thing about ubers, is that they're usually cheaper than most taxis. So I highly suggest that you try it out!', Bug Report

'I've been using uber for a while now, but each experience has left me less and less impressed. They estimate a short wait time, but arrive later and later; assume I want to use the pool option when I have no desire to use it, and have not picked me up at my location the last 4 times I used the app- instead I had to walk several blocks to meet them. In addition, suburban drivers have no idea where they are going in the city- I live in Chicago- and make no effort to use their gps. It's getting frustrating, and I'm less inclined to use their service.', Other

'Your app is crap... One day it works and the next it could be open all day doing the loading logo. For someone who uses uber regularly nothing is more annoying then not being able to use the app. Iv tried reinstalling it half a dozen times and check to make sure it's updated . Iv tried useing it on wifi and cellular data with the same results. iPhone 5s here completely up to date . If like to add the just got a iPhone 6s and updated the app now it says the service is not compatible with my device and ask me repeatedly to verify my card info, even after I verify half a dozen times . This is ridiculous. This is why I'll start using Lyft app in place of uber because it's not a constant battle to get it to work.', Other

'If you have unused referral credits in your account (typically $15) that are going to expire soon, Uber will flood you with lower value promotions ($5) to keep you from using your $15 credit, which will probably expire before you get a chance to use it. Make no mistake, this is done intentionally, and there's nothing you can do about it. Also, surge pricing is unacceptable. Done with Uber.', Feature Request

'This app is not intuitive. I used it for the first time today and every step was an exercise in frustration!  I had no clue what the icons meant. I just wanted a car to come!  I finally googled "how do I use the Uber app" and found out which icon to pick for a normal car.  Then I struggled through another screen trying to find a button to push that would send my request.  I finally realized I was stuck on a surge pricing screen (with no explanation of what that is). I was in a hurry and needed a ride and nothing was making any sense on the app!  Finally I figured it out but my first experience SUCKED.', Other

'I used Uber for the first time while in Savannah on vacation with my sister.  My husband has used them numerous times while traveling so I felt safe in trying this new experience.  Our Driver Eric was very polite and informative on questions we had about other places.  He made us feel safe and the cost was very reasonable.  We had called a cab company first and it is as going to be a 45 minute wait. This is when we decided to go for Uber.  Eric was there to pick us up within three to four minutes.
