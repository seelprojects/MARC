Its really quite cumbersome. I wish I could recover an old tab without erasing the one Im in. Furthermore while the swiping far leftright to navigate backforward between pages feature is handy it is still a mobile app and you usually need to zoom and navigate around a page so it would be nice to have the option to disableenable that feature when needed.

'Im giving the NFL 12 v3 update three stars largely because its an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable.nnHowever it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasnt following play-by-play. The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages this is very frustrating--theres no way for example to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that at least for the Thursday games in week 2 the teams do not switch properly checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button I get the passing stats for A. Dalton if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams. Im hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly but it reflects poorly on the product. I apologize for the comments length Im hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.',BugReport

The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

Although there are things about it that really annoy me.  1 If you miss a day of adding calories there is no way to go back to that day once midnight hits to enter your intake.  This needs to be fixed ASAP  2 Manual input of at least exercises not calories or info from the workout needs to be permitted just how you can manually input your sleep.

Now this may seem nice to have my friends see this but its all wrong. I wish there was a way to make an AIRPLANE mode while your dirt biking or for instances like this so the watch goes dead and maybe just tracks your heart rate. Or build into the app a sensitive option like you have for sleeping. I know Im not the only one so PLEASE look into this. Other then that. Amazing.',FeatureRequest

After a modest amount of use the app appears much more stable.nnHowever it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone so far as I can tell I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasnt following play-by-play. The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB passing 1 player rushing and 2 receivers with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing.

Never thought this day would come.',Other
'Google has a tendency to change things for no reason despite what users actually want. Sometimes this is fine and sometimes its for the worse. In the case of removing swiping to switch tabs its for the much worse. The nice thing about tab swiping is you dont need to reach all the way up to the top of the screen to switch tabs. This is especially important on bigger phones like the 6 and 6 Plus. Its not a good solution to swipe at the navigation bar because thats still too far for the my thumb to reach without adjusting my grip. ',Other
'Why keep releasing updates with 3 updates at a time it makes no sense. From such a large company like google you would think they would move faster on these updates. Microsoft right now is kicking googles but when it comes to features in its apps and update quality. Why are these apps still so limited compared to the web counterparts and also why is there still no properly optimized iPad pro software. Get it together Google its just ridiculous at this point.',Other

'Miss the recent visited tiles showing a picture of the website and not just a odd looking box now',Other
'One of the most important features Chrome had was Data Saver.  Not everyone has unlimited data and every bit saved counts in the long run.  Now that it is gone Chrome is just as network resource greedy as all the others.',Other
'Chrome was the best browser for the simple fact that it saved you in the amount of data used. With the most recent update data saver is gone If I new that I wouldnt have updated it Bring it back until then Im deleting this app.',Other
'Chrome is great on my pc but this one is really pointless. It has no advanced features except annoyances.  And it eats my battery. I think Google needs to put a bit more effort into this if they want a good web browser. Ill delete it for now.',Other

'Browsing just got so much faster and less janky with the latest release. I dont mind losing data saver at all if it means that scrolling and browsing are this much smoother. Thank you',Other
'This is unacceptable and a terrible move on the part of Google and the app makers',Other
'As someone who likes to read long content on their phone this update is killing me. When you turn your device sideways the print gets larger. Much much larger. Unnecessarily large. Its true that Ive had fewer crashes but at the cost of readability. Id rather restart the app every once in a while rather than this.',Other
'I love it and Ive been using FOR.EV.ER now  Is it completely perfect  No  But common its way better than safari  I mean. . Common',Other

'Very noticeable speed increase. Makes browsing the internet on my phone much faster and more efficient. I think this update is very effective after about an hour of use',Other
'I cant listen to music anymore when quit the app. Worst update ever was better without it. You cant listen to music while using other apps',Other
'I no longer have a reason to use this app over Safari.',Other
'Very disappointed in the changes youve been making Google. First you make the simplicity of the tab-switching feature MUCH less convenient by constricting it to the URL bar. Now youve made the tabs of the most-visited webpages ugly and harder to use. I dont understand your decisions.',Other
'So the do not track option vanished although it is still present in Safari.',Other
'This app has been very useful for me to monitor my credit. And although it is not the same as running a credit report for accuracy. It is quick and easy and provides very useful information. I would definitely recommend it as a tool to help keep a handle on your credit.',Other
'Great idea- but why they decide to pull ur credit score just to relay a consistently higher number than what my score really is- also my wifes score according to karma is 100  thats right 100 points higher than her REAL score. Just relay the numbers the big 3 give u and dont rate our scores higher than reality- total bogus B.S. app.',Other

When our credit was ran by the bank our numbers came back more than 60 points different This app is completely pointless if it doesnt reflect even close to the correct number.

'So I love the app because its free. My problem is the Vantage Scoring system is way off from myFico score. I mean nearly a 100 points off which makes me wonder what is so significantly different with this system Also Ive made some great strides in the past few months and my score has changed by one point according to Credit Karma.

'This application does not provide a true credit score. I have paid my credits long ago and it still shows that I own the same amount and gives me lower credit score.

Now I believe that there is a rumor that Facebook is about to give pages the ability to monetize videos they post so they can gain money. THIS IS INSANE If no copyright guidelines are instated thousands of freebooters will be able to gain money off of stealing videos Facebooks lack of copyright guidelines will spawn hundreds and hundreds of freebooter pages that will be gaining money off of exploitation I dont know what you people were thinking about not having copyright guidelines but letting people be able to upload videos for money Instate copyright guidelines into Facebook so that thieves wont gain money.',Other
